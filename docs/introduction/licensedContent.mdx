title: Licensed Content

Illumina Conncted Annotations supports following content which is available through a license from Illumina.
The license file will allow users to download and annotate with these data sources.
* COSMIC
* OMIM
* Primate AI-3D
* Splice AI

:::tip
License may be customized to allow access to one of more of the above at the time of license creation.
:::

:::note
The Annotator packaged with DRAGEN comes with a license for all premium contents. 
That is, if the Annotator is run from within DRAGEN, all premium content will be available. 
However, this doesn't automatically grant a license to get premium contents while running the Annotator outside of DRAGEN.
Please contact annotation_support@illumina.com for stand-alone licenses.

## How to obtain the license?
Please contact annotation_support@illumina.com to obtain a special credentials file for the data sources of interest.

Visit [Illumina Connected Annotations](https://developer.illumina.com/illumina-connected-annotations) for more details.

## How to use the credentials file?
After obtaining the credentials file, it may be used in two ways:
1. Home folder
2. Commandline argument

The default location of the license file is `~/.ilmnAnnotations/credentials.json`. An example of credentials file as below:
```json
{
	"ApiKey":"myApiKey",
	"ApiSecret": "abcdefghikjlmnopqrstuvwxyz-secretKey"
}
```
However, this can be overridden by the command line argument while downloading/annotating.

### Download licensed content
```shell
dotnet Downloader.dll \
-o ~/data \
-ga GRCh38 \
--credentialsFile ~/credentials.json
```


### Annotate with licensed content
```shell
dotnet Annotator.dll \
--ref ~/data/References/7/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.Nirvana.dat \
--sd ~/data/SupplementaryDatabase \
-c ~/data/Cache/32 \
-i ~/input_vcf-hg38.vcf.gz \
-o ~/output \
--credentialsFile ~/credentials.json
```


## Licensing Errors
If the license has expired, Illumina Connected Annotations will stop annotating and exit with an error code.
These errors may be skipped by using the `--ignoreLicenseError` command line argument.
After doing this, only basic data sources will be used for annotations.
This can also be achieved by deleting the credentials file from the home folder.
