## Overview

COSMIC, the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, is the world's largest source of expert manually curated somatic mutation information relating to human 
cancers.

## Small Variants

Our main COSMIC deliverable provides annotations for both coding and non-coding variants throughout the genome. As of COSMIC v96, this includes 28.7M variants 
spanning the human genome. Illumina Connected Annotations currently parses four files to extract the relevant content:
* CosmicCodingMuts.vcf.gz
* CosmicNonCodingVariants.vcf.gz
* CosmicMutantExport.tsv.gz
* CosmicNCV.tsv.gz

### VCF extraction

#### Example

```scss
#CHROM  POS ID  REF ALT QUAL  FILTER  INFO
1 65797 COSV58737189  T C . . GENE=OR4F5_ENST00000641515;STRAND=+;LEGACY_ID=COSN23957695;CDS=c.9+224T>C;AA=p.?;HGVSC=ENST00000641515.2:c.9+224T>C;HGVSG=1:g.65797T>C;CNT=1
```

#### Parsing

From the VCF files, we're mainly interested in the following columns:
* `CHROM`
* `POS`
* `ID`
* `REF`
* `ALT`

### TSV extraction

#### Example

```scss
Gene name Accession Number  Gene CDS length HGNC ID Sample name ID_sample ID_tumour Primary site  Site subtype 1  Site subtype 2  Site subtype 3  Primary histology Histology subtype 1 Histology subtype 2 Histology subtype 3 Genome-wide screen  GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID LEGACY_MUTATION_ID  MUTATION_ID Mutation CDS  Mutation AA Mutation Description  Mutation zygosity LOH GRCh  Mutation genome position  Mutation strand Resistance Mutation Mutation somatic status Pubmed_PMID ID_STUDY  Sample Type Tumour origin Age HGVSP HGVSC HGVSG

```

#### Parsing

From the TSV file, we're mainly interested in the following columns:
* `GENOMIC_MUTATION_ID`
* `ID_sample`
* `Primary site`
* `Site subtype 1`
* `Primary histology`
* `Histology subtype 1`
* `Pubmed_PMID`
* `Resistance Mutation`
* `Mutation somatic status`

:::info
For all the histologies and sites, we replace all the underlines with spaces. `salivary_gland` would become `salivary gland`.
:::

#### Parsing

To aggregate the data in Illumina Connected Annotations, we perform the following:
* Parse the coding and non-coding TSV files to retrieve the histologies, sites, PubMed IDs, somatic status, and resistance mutation status. Histologies and sites 
are tracked with respect to sample IDs.
* Parse the coding and non-coding VCF files to retrieve the genomic variant for each entry

#### Aggregating Histologies & Sites

For sites and histologies, we observe that the subtype provides additional description but is still dependent on the primary site value. For example, the primary 
site might be `skin`, but the subtype is `foot`. Therefore, we will combine the values in the following manner: `skin (foot)`. 

COSMIC uses `NS` to show that a value is empty. If the subtype is `NS`, we will use the primary histology instead.

## Gene Fusions

Gene fusions are manually curated from peer reviewed publications by expert COSMIC curators. A comprehensive literature curation is completed for each fusion 
pair when it is released in the database. Currently COSMIC includes information on fusions involved in solid tumours and leukaemias.

### TSV extraction

```

#### Parsing

From the TSV file, we're mainly interested in the following columns:
* `SAMPLE_ID`
* `PRIMARY_SITE`
* `PRIMARY_HISTOLOGY`
* `HISTOLOGY_SUBTYPE_1`
* `FUSION_ID`
* `TRANSLOCATION_NAME`
* `PUBMED_PMID`

:::info
For all the histologies and sites, we replace all the underlines with spaces. `salivary_gland` would become `salivary gland`.
:::

#### Parsing

To create the gene fusion entries in Illumina Connected Annotations, we perform the following on each row in the TSV file:
* Group all entries by FUSION_ID
* Using all the entries related to this FUSION_ID:
  * Collect all the PubMed IDs
  * Tally the number of observed sample IDs
  * Grab the HGVS r. notation (should not change throughout the FUSION_ID)
  * Tally the number of samples observed for each histology
  * Tally the number of samples observed for each site
* Extract the transcript IDs from the HGVS notation and lookup the associated gene symbols

#### Aggregating Histologies & Sites

[Aggregating Histologies & Sites](#aggregating-histologies--sites) was previously described in the small variants section.

### Known Issues

:::caution Known Issues
There are some issues with the HGVS RNA notation:
* For coding transcripts, HGVS numbering should use CDS coordinates. Right now COSMIC is using cDNA coordinates for all their fusions.

## Cancer Gene Census
### TSV Extraction
#### Example
```scss
GENE_NAME       CELL_TYPE       PUBMED_PMID     HALLMARK        IMPACT  DESCRIPTION     CELL_LINE
PRDM16		18496560	role in cancer	oncogene	oncogene
PRDM16		16015645	role in cancer	fusion	fusion
```

#### Parsing
To extract information about TSGs and oncogenes, the data based on the "role in cancer" attribute is filtered.
For tumor suppressor genes, rows with the value "TSG" and for oncogenes, rows with the value "oncogene" are filtered.
Some genes have both "TSG/oncogene" as their role, which indicates that they can act as both.

##### Columns
Only following columns are needed to gather required roles in cancer:
* `GENE_NAME`
* `IMPACT`
* `HALLMARK`


##### Possible Roles in Cancer
The file contained following number of instances for each role type

| Role in cancer | Total Instances |
|:---------------|:---------------:|
| fusion         |       149       |
| TSG            |       195       |
| oncogene       |       181       |
| Total          |       525       |

### CSV Extraction
COSMIC Tiers are extracted from `cancer_gene_census.csv` file:
