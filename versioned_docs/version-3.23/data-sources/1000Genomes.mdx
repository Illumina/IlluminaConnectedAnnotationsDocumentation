## Overview

The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project was to find most genetic variants with frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied. It was the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic variation. Data from the 1000 Genomes Project was quickly made available to the worldwide scientific community through freely accessible public databases.

## Populations
* The super population membership can be found here: (http://www.1000genomes.org/category/population/)
* We want to capture the allele frequencies for all 26 populations as well as the 5 super populations and the total population.

## Small Variants
### VCF File Parsing
The original VCF files come with allele frequency fields (e.g. ALL_AF, AMR_AF) but we recompute them using allele counts and allele numbers in order to get 6 digit precision. The allele counts and allele numbers (e.g. AMR_AC, AMR_AN) are not expressed in the INFO field. Instead the genotypes need to be parsed to compute that information. Our team converted the original data to VCF entries with allele counts and allele numbers like the following.

```scss
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
1       15274   rs62636497      A       G,T     100     PASS    AC=1739,3210;AF=0.347244,0.640974;AN=5008;NS=2504;DP=23255;EAS_AF=0.4812,0.5188;AMR_AF=0.2752,0.7205;AFR_AF=0.323,0.6369;EUR_AF=0.2922,0.7078;SAS_AF=0.3497,0.6472;AA=g|||;VT=SNP;MULTI_ALLELIC;EAS_AN=1008;EAS_AC=485,523;EUR_AN=1006;EUR_AC=294,712;AFR_AN=1322;AFR_AC=427,842;AMR_AN=694;AMR_AC=191,500;SAS_AN=978;SAS_AC=342,633
```

The ancestral allele, if it exists, is the first value in the pipe separated AA fields (the Indel specific REF, ALT, IndelType fields are ignored).

We parse the VCF file and extract the following fields from INFO:
* AA
* AC
* AN
* EAS_AN
* AMR_AN
* AFR_AN
* EUR_AN
* SAS_AN
* EAS_AC
* AMR_AC
* AFR_AC
* EUR_AC
* SAS_AC


#### Conflict Resolution
We have observed conflicting allele frequency information in the source. Take the following example:
```scss
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
1 20505705 rs35377696 C CTCTG,CTG,CTGTG 100 PASS AC=46,1513,152;AF=0.0091853,0.302117,0.0303514;
1 20505705 rs35377696 C CTG 100 PASS AC=4;AF=0.000798722;
```
That is, the variant 1-20505705-C-CTG has conflicting entries. To get an idea of how frequently we observe this, here is a table summarizing ChrX and all chromosomes. Note that almost all such entries are found in ChrX.

|Chromosome | \# of alleles    | \# of conflicting alleles | percentage|
|:---------:|:-----------------|:--------------:|:-----------------|
| chrX      |       834800     |       2733     |           0.33%  |
| Total     |       21413098   |       2743     |           0.013% |

**Currently**, we removed the allele frequency of the conflicting allele (i.e., insertion TG in the example) but keep allele frequencies of all other alleles in the VCF line.

**Potential Alternate Solutions**
* Remove all alleles that are contained in the vcf lines which have conflicting allele. (Recommended by 1000 genome group Holly Zheng-Bradley, 7/29/2015)
* Recalculate the allele frequency for the conflicting allele.
* Pick the allele frequency that has the highest data support.

## Structural Variants
### VCF File Parsing
The VCF files contain entries like the following:
```scss
#CHROM  POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO    FORMAT  HG00096 HG00097 HG00099 HG00100 HG00101 HG00102 HG00103
22      16050654        esv3647175;esv3647176;esv3647177;esv3647178     A       <CN0>,<CN2>,<CN3>,<CN4> 100     PASS  AC=9,87,599,20;AF=0.00179712,0.0173722,0.119609,0.00399361;AN=5008;CS=DUP_gs;END=16063474;NS=2504;SVTYPE=CNV;DP=22545;EAS_AF=0.001,0.0169,0.2361,0.0099;AMR_AF=0,0.0101,0.219,0.0072;AFR_AF=0.0061,0.0363,0.0053,0;EUR_AF=0,0.007,0.0944,0.003;SAS_AF=0,0.0082,0.1094,0.002;VT=SV       GT      3|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|4
```
Please note that, CNVs are allele-specific. For example, HG00096 is effectively copy number 4, which would be a net gain on chr22.

1000 Genomes contains 5 types of structural variants:
* CNV
* DEL
* DUP
* INS
* INV

Since data of 1000 genomes is provided in VCF format, we assume that the coordinates follow the vcf format, i.e., there is a padding base for symbolic alleles. So all the interval can be interpreted as [BEGIN+1, END].
Similarly, for all other variant types except insertion, END is far larger than BEGIN. The distribution of BEGIN and END for insertions is summarized below.

**Insertion issues**
* END = BEGIN for 6/165
* END = BEGIN+2 for 93/165
* END = BEGIN+3 for 11/165
* END = BEGIN+4 for 11/165
* END – BEGIN range from 5 to 1156 for others.


### Converting VCF svTypes to SO sequence alterations
The svType will be captured in our JSON file under the [sequenceAlteration](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001059) key. Here's the translation we'll use according to svType in 1000 Genomes.

| SVA    | FALSE                             | mobile_element_insertion                                      |
| INV    | FALSE                             | inversion                                                     |

*We discard structural variants without END*

```

**CNVs in chrY**
* No other types of structural variants exist in chrY
* Since copy number is provided in genotype field, we directly parse the copy number from "CN" field.
* For most CNVs in chrY, the reference copy number is 1, but the refence number for CNVs in segmental duplication sites is 2 (<CN2\> in the 2nd example). All segmental duplication calls have identifiers starting with GS_SD_M2.
