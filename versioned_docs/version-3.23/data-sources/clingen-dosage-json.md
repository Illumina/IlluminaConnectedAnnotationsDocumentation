**haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity**
- no evidence to suggest that dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype
- little evidence suggesting dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype
- emerging evidence suggesting dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype
- sufficient evidence suggesting dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype
- gene associated with autosomal recessive phenotype
- dosage sensitivity unlikely
