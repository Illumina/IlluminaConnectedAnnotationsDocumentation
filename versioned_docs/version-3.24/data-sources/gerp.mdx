## Overview
GERP identifies constrained elements in multiple alignments by quantifying substitution deficits.
These deficits represent substitutions that would have occurred if the element were neutral DNA, but did not occur because the element has been under functional constraint (Rejected Substitutions).
Illumina Connected Annotations uses GERP++ which is based on a significantly faster and more statistically robust maximum likelihood estimation procedure to compute expected rates of evolution.

### Parsing

From the CSV file, we are interested in columns:
* `chr`
* `position`
* `GERP`
