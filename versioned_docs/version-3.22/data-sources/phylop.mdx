## Overview

PhyloP (phylogenetic p-values) conservation scores are obtained from the [PHAST package] (http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast/) for multiple alignments of vertebrate genomes to the human genome. For GRCh38, the multiple alignments are against 19 mammals and for GRCh37, it is against 45 vertebrate genomes.

## WigFix File
The data is provided in WigFix files which is a text file that provides conservation scores for contiguous intervals in the following format:
```scss
fixedStep chrom=chr1 start=10918 step=1
0.064
0.058
0.064

```
We convert them to binary files with indexes for fast query. Note that these are scores for genomic positions and are reported only for SNVs.
