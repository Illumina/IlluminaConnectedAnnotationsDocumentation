## Overview

dbSNP contains human single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions along with publication, population frequency, molecular consequence, and genomic and RefSeq mapping information for both common variations and clinical mutations.

## VCF File

### Example

```scss
#CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
1	10177	rs367896724	A	AC	.	.	RS=367896724;RSPOS=10177;dbSNPBuildID=138; \ 
      SSR=0;SAO=0;VP=0x050000020005130026000200;GENEINFO=DDX11L1:100287102;WGT=1; \
      VC=DIV;R5;ASP;G5A;G5;KGPhase3;CAF=0.5747,0.4253;COMMON=1; \
      TOPMED=0.76728147298674821,0.23271852701325178
```

### Parsing

From the VCF file, we're mainly interested in the following:
* `rsID` from the `ID` field
* `CAF` from the `INFO` field

#### Global allele extraction

The global major and minor alleles are extracted based on the frequency of the alleles provided in the CAF field. The global minor allele frequency is the second highest value of the CAF comma delimited field (ignoring '.' values). 

:::tip Tie Breaking: Global Major Allele
If there are two candidates for global major and the reference allele is one of them, we prefer the reference allele.
:::

:::tip Tie Breaking: Global Minor Allele
If there are two candidates for global minor and the reference allele is one of them, we prefer the other allele. If the reference allele is not involved, they are chosen arbitrarily.
:::

#### Equal Allele Frequency Example (2 alleles)

```scss
chr1	100	A	C	CAF=0.5,0.5
```

We will select A to be the global major allele and C to be the global minor allele.

#### Equal Allele Frequency Example (3 alleles)

```scss
chr1	100	A	C,T	CAF=0.33,0.33,0.33
```

We will select A to be the global major allele and either C or T is chosen (arbitrarily) to be the global minor allele.

#### Equal Allele Frequency in Alternate Alleles

```scss
chr1	100	A	C,T	CAF=0.2,0.4,0.4
```

We will select C or T to be arbitrarily assigned to be the global major or global minor allele.

#### Equal Allele Frequency Between Reference & Alternate Allele

```scss
chr1	100	A	C,T	CAF=0.2,0.2,0.6
```

We will select T to be the global major allele and C to be the global minor allele.

## Known Issues

:::caution Known Issues
If there are multiple entries with different CAF values for the same allele, we use the first CAF value.
