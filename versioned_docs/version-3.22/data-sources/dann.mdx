## Overview
DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion) to train a deep neural network (DNN).
CADD is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms.
DANN improves on CADD (which uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) by capturing non-linear relationships by using a deep neural network instead of SVMs.
DANN achieves about a 19% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADDâ€™s SVM methodology.

```

### Parsing

From the CSV file, we are interested in all columns:
* `chr`
* `grch37_pos`
* `ref`
* `alt`
* `DANN`

## GRCh38 liftover

The data is not available for GRCh38 on DANN website. We performed a liftover from GRCh37 to GRCh38 using crossmap.
